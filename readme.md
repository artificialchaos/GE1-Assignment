This project consists of a infinitely generating terrain made of tiles. 
The GameObjects which form the "city" are instantiated along with the tiles using a coroutine.
The player can explore the scene using an fps controller.
GameObjects are removed from the scene if the player moves too far away.

All Unity objects were created by me, materials were made from images found online.
The 'FPSControl' and 'Utility' scripts were taken from examples in class.
The terrain generation functionality in the scripts 'PerlinTerrain' and 'TerrainGeneration' 
was adapted from examples from class and editted to suit by purposes.
The code for generating all other game objects was written by me and added to the 'TerrainGeneration' script.

I was unable to implement a lot of my ideas for this project due to poor time management 
but I was happy how I generated the grid of roads with cars travelling over them.
